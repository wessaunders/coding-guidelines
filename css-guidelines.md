# Terminology

## Rule declaration
A “rule declaration” is the name given to a selector (or a group of selectors) with an accompanying group of properties. Here's an example:
```
.listing {
    font-size: 18px;
    line-height: 1.2;
}
```



# CSS
When using multiple selectors, give each selector its own line

Organize one selector per line, even when placing all of them at the same line doesn't exceed 80 columns.
